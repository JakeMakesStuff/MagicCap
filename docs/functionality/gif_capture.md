# GIF Capture
GIF capture works by opening up the region selector and getting the user to select the region they want to capture. If the user does not have ffmpeg configured, they will be required to do so now. From here, a stop button is put into the task tray and the capture is started. When the stop button is pressed, the footage is transcoded and a URL is returned.
