# File Configuration
The file configuration will define how files are stored and named using MagicCap. There are several configuration options:
- `Save files to your device after capturing.` - This defines if the captures you make should also be saved to your system. If this is off, it will only be uploaded.
- `File Naming Pattern` - This is the pattern which is used to generate the filenames for the files. There are several attributes which can be used to repersent items in the filename:
    - `"` - Repersents a random character.
    - `%emoji%` - Repersents a random emoji.
    - `%date%` - Repersents the date.
    - `%time%` - Repersents the time.
- `File Save Folder` - Repersents the folder which MagicCap will save captures in if saving is enabled.
