# MagicCap Support

## GitHub Issues

The best place to get formal help for any issue you are experiencing with MagicCap, or to report a bug or even to
request a new feature, is through the issue tracker provided by GitHub in this repository.

Head to **https://github.com/MagicCap/MagicCap/issues** to view existing, open issues.\
Go direct to **https://github.com/MagicCap/MagicCap/issues/new** to submit a new issue (help request, bug report or
feature suggestion)

## Discord

We also have a Discord server where you can find the developers of MagicCap as well as many users of the program.
This is often the best place to ask simple questions to get fast support for issues that don't require an issue report
and investigation by the developers.

You can join our Discord server at **https://discord.gg/gz52jPR**
