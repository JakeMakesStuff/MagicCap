MagicCap is a image/GIF capture suite for Mac and Linux. You can get a precompiled copy from the releases page of this GitHub page. It has the following features:

- Very cross compatible. You should get the same experience on Mac and Linux.
- Very easy to add to. You don't need to faff around with modifying HTML; instead you write a small file that includes all of the config options and the upload script (most of this is handled by `capture.js` anyway).
- Very fast. Captures are optimised to be as fast as possible.
- Very flexible. You can choose to upload to whatever service you want to or just save the file.
- Very functional. Want to capture a GIF? No problem. Want to blur a screenshot? No problem. MagicCap is there to help you with whatever you want.

# This is not for Windows!
[ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) is amazing for that!
